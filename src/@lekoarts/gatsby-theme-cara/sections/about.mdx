## About

> I am a tenured manager at Microsoft Azure, with passion for building organizations, mentoring and leading people for success.

In my job, I am leading the Israeli site for Azure Networking, with a goal of making it the center of excellence in network security for the entire organization. 
I have extensive background in cybersecurity, as well as experience building successful teams in startups and corporates. 
I have specific passion for hiring and building teams, and I also consult teams in how to build tailor-made hiring processes. 
With the experience I've gained, I find myself enjoying giving talks on cloud, network security, people leadership, and future of work.
